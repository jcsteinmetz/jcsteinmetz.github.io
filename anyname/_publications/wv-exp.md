abstract: "Optical interferometry plays an essential role in precision metrology such as in gravitational wave detection, gyroscopes, and environmental sensing. Weak value amplification enables reaching the shot-noise-limit of sensitivity, which is difficult for most optical sensors, by amplifying the interferometric signal without amplifying certain technical noises. We implement a generalized form of weak value amplification on an integrated photonic platform with a multi-mode interferometer. Our results pave the way for a more sensitive, robust, and compact platform for measuring phase, which can be adapted to fields such as coherent communications and the quantum domain. In this work, we show a 7 dB signal enhancement in our weak value device over a standard Mach-Zehnder interferometer with equal detected optical power, as well as frequency measurements with 2 kHz sensitivity by adding a ring resonator."
