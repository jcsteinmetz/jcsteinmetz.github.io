abstract: "A photonic device for detecting rotation and a corresponding method for operation thereof are disclosed. The photonic device includes a readout structure coupled to a ring resonator at one or more coupling points. Light is split between a lower waveguide and an upper waveguide of the readout structure in a forward direction at a beam splitter. The light in the waveguides traveling in the forward direction is coupled into the ring resonator and subsequently back into the waveguides in a reverse direction. The light is spatially phase tilted and is combined at the beam splitter. The combined light is detected by a split detector."
